== Description ==

= How does it work? =

Custom Code Keeper for Gravity Forms‚Ä¶

- creates a directory at `wp-content/uploads/gravity_hopper/code/`.
- adds a file `gf-global-code.php` *(for housing globally run code)*.
- optionally creates/duplicates/deletes a `gf-00xx.php` file for every form created/duplicated/deleted. *(for housing form-specific code)*
- will load all files in the code directory associated with an existing form or having prefix that has been explicitly allowed.
- allows exporting any number of code files to compressed .zip.
- introduces a form settings page whereby you can preview relevant custom code and create a file if one doesn't yet exist.

**Please note that Custom Code Keeper is intended for code organization only and doesn't restrict when code is run. All code from allowed files residing in the `gravity_hopper/code/` directory will run for all forms. Always use appropriate hooks and/or conditional checks when targeting specific forms and fields.**

= Why use it? =

Custom Code Keeper provides orderliness to your code customizations, gives you a better sense of the specific code running across your site, and helps ensure your customizations are not lost when other site modifications are made.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Custom Code Keeper load custom code per form? =

No. This plugin is intended for code wrangling only and does not restrict when code is run. All code residing in files prefixed with `gf-` or `gform-` in the `gravity_hopper/code/` directory will run for all forms. Always use appropriate hooks and/or conditional checks when targeting specific forms and fields.

= Can I edit the custom code from within my WordPress dashboard? =

No. While each form provides a Custom Code previewer, the actual codes needs to be edited directly from within the files housed on your server.

= How are files loaded? =

Allowed files within the directory `gravity_hopper/code/` of your uploads directory will be loaded.

The file `gf-global-code.php` will always be loaded and will be loaded before other files. If you need to declare classes for use in other code, this is the file in which to do so.

Any files matching prefix patterns allowed via the filter `gravityhopper-cck/allowed_file_prefixes` will be loaded next.

Finally, any form-specific files named using the convention `gform-00xx.php` will be loaded next, provided a form matching the ID exists on the site.

== Installation ==

After installation and activation on your WordPress site, you will find a new `gravity_hopper/code` directory for housing your Gravity Forms related code within your WordPress site's `upload` folder.
